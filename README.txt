README - Birthday Webpage (replace assets with real files)
----------------------------------------

Files in this ZIP:
  - index.html
  - assets/
      - photo1.jpg
      - photo2.jpg
      - photo3.jpg
      - khairiyat.mp3

âœ… To finish:
  1) Replace assets/photo1.jpg, assets/photo2.jpg, assets/photo3.jpg with your real photos.
  2) Replace assets/khairiyat.mp3 with the actual Khairiyat MP3 file.
  3) Open index.html in a browser (or host on GitHub Pages).

Notes:
  - Some mobile browsers block autoplay of audible audio until the user interacts with the page.
    The page attempts autoplay and also listens for the first tap/click to unlock audio.
  - If you want the three photo thumbnails to be interactive file pickers (so you can replace images from the phone),
    tell me and I can add a local file picker implementation.
  - To publish: upload the entire contents to GitHub Pages or any static host.

If you want, send me the 3 images and the mp3 and I'll replace them and give you a final ZIP with actual assets included.
